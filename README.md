# Reflection Answers:

Branch Design Challenge: The most challenging part for me was creating the conversation branches and ensuring each branch included enough information so the agent could properly reply or have a backup plan. Some of the voice agents would apologize if they were asked a question on a conversation branch that they did not know much about or did not have enough information on. They would also try to direct you to the main page or to a phone number for additional help. For example, when I asked where a certain building was on campus, he couldn't find the building I was talking about, but offered to list the other buildings in case one sounded familiar, and also suggested I could schedule a tour online or research the campus map on the college website.

Knowledge Base Impact: The extensive knowledge base that I added significantly affected how my agent responded; it was able to pull a ton of information out and give me tuition prices, building locations, clubs, activities, and other events on campus, and other information I asked for. I feel like the more content you add to the knowledge base, the less the agent is going to say, "I'm sorry, I don't have any knowledge on that," and actually be able to answer the question. I included every website I could think of related to the three branches and the college from Coyote Connect PDFs, technical support websites, and the main college website to campus maps, the library website, and many others. This created a variety of answers and information for the agent to process, and I think that the more detailed content or the more varieties of content you include, the better responses the agent will have. 

Real-World Application: This agent could be used on any college campus website or on a computer or device that is accessible to all students on campus to be able to talk or type questions without having to search for faculty, staff, or another student for help. This would ease students' worries and enable them to efficiently and quickly ask questions and receive answers or directions. I also believe this could help faculty out when a student asks a question, and they do not have time to search up the answer, or they just don't know it themselves. They could just type in the question, and have the agent dig through the knowledge database it has for that college, and then the faculty will be able to answer questions even if they don't know. Furthermore, this agent can also provide students with faculty phone numbers, so if the issue cannot be resolved by the agent they can be properly directed to someone who can.
