# Reflection Answers:

Branch Design Challenge: The most challenging part for me was creating the conversation branches and ensuring each branch included enough information so the agent could properly reply or have a backup plan. Some of the voice agents would apologize if they were asked a question on a conversation branch that they did not know much about or did not have enough information on. They would also try to direct you to the main page or to a phone number for additional help. For example, when I asked where a certain building was on campus, he couldn't find the building I was talking about, but offered to list the other buildings in case one sounded familiar, and also suggested I could schedule a tour online or research the campus map on the college website.

Knowledge Base Impact: How did the knowledge base content you added affect the agent's responses? Did certain types of content work better than others?

Real-World Application: What real-world application could this voice agent have? Think about a specific industry, business, or use case where this type of agent would be valuable.
